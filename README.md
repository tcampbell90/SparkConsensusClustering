# SparkConsensusClustering
Using Apache Spark MLlib clustering library to explore data sets via unsupervised machine learning techniques. Scripts to determine optimal number of clusters; compare performance between three clustering algorithms via consensus clustering; and finally running using a trick to examine feature importance for determining cluster via Random Forest feature importance vector.
